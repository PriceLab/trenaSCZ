### notes from seth, email (20 sep 2017)

The best SCZ RNA-seq dataset is on Synapse. The individual-level
data are controlled access, but the differential expression results
are public and available here:
https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn5607603 I think that's the
main thing we want to display, anyway.

I don't yet have the ATAC-seq data from these samples. It was
generated trough PsychENCODE, and I'm still applying for the
data. In the meantime, a closely related dataset is here:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE83345

A handful of genes of interest in this dataset are FURIN, TSNARE1,
CNTN4, CLCN3, SNAP91, SOX2, FOXG1, and SREBF1.

The SCZ GWAS are available here:
